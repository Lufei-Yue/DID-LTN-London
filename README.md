# How Effective are Low Traffic Neighbourhoods in Reducing Traffic Accidents? 

**Overview**

Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs) are urban planning interventions aimed at reducing through traffic and improving road safety for pedestrians and cyclists. This study evaluates the effectiveness of LTNs in reducing traffic accidents in London using a Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach. The study analyzes annual traffic accident data from 2015 to 2024 and employs both a traditional DID model and an improved DID model to assess the short- and long-term effects of LTNs.
